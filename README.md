# Scrabble (In Progress)
Welcome to my Scrabble board game project.  
This game will be single player vs computer.  

###### **Motivation:**  
I wanted to make this game because my predictions on the data structures will be used in this game will be fun to work with and strenghten my skills on them.

###### **Theory**

**Scrabble Board**  

The board will be made as a 15 x 15 array of the object Cell.  
Cell objects contain a string called bonus and will be assigned accordingly. (e.g.: board[0]0].string = 3W)
